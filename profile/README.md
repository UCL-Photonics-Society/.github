# Welcome to the UCL Photonics Society GitHub Organisation! ðŸ‘‹

## Who We Are

The UCL Photonics Society is committed to redefining the way students engage with optics and photonics. We provide a platform for students to explore and expand their knowledge in this exciting field. The society holds monthly technical workshops and seminars for students to learn more about the field. Socials are organised for network opportunities. 

This is the Society's GitHub Organisation, aimed at facilitating the sharing of programming ressources, and engaging with the open source community.
